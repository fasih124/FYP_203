Yes, Firebase is not suitable for live streaming due to latency and storage costs. Instead, the Flutter app will display the ESP32-CAM stream using an MJPEG video stream over HTTP.

How Flutter Displays ESP32-CAM Stream

ESP32-CAM hosts an MJPEG stream on http://<ESP_IP>:81/stream.

Flutter fetches and displays the stream using an Image.network() widget or a WebView.

Flutter Code to Display ESP32-CAM Stream

Method 1: Using Image.network() (Simplest)

This method loads the MJPEG stream like a normal image.

Note: This works but may not be smooth.

Method 2: Using flutter_inappwebview (Recommended)

Use an embedded WebView to display the ESP32-CAM's MJPEG stream.


Why WebView?
It directly plays the stream with lower latency and better performance.

How to Get the ESP32-CAM Stream URL

Upload this ESP32-CAM code in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO:

After flashing, check the Serial Monitor for the ESP32 IP address.
Example output: Camera Ready! Use 'http://192.168.1.100:81/stream' to view 

Replace YOUR_ESP32_IP in Flutter code with the actual IP.

Final Thoughts

For best results, use WebView in Flutter.

Ensure ESP32-CAM and phone are on the same WiFi.

Use a static IP or mDNS (http://esp32cam.local/stream) for consistency.
